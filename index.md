# Fishing Prediction System

## Overview
The Fishing Prediction System is an IoT device designed to help anglers by predicting fishing success rates based on weather conditions such as temperature, pressure, and GPS location.

## Features
- **Real-time Weather Integration**: Uses OpenWeather API for live data.
- **GPS-Based Tracking**: Analyzes location data to improve predictions.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilizes SVM and K-means clustering to analyze fishing conditions.
- **Offline Mode**: Can operate offline using pre-trained models.
- **Portable Design**: Powered by ESP32, making it suitable for outdoor use.
