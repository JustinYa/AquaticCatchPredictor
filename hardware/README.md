# Hardware Folder

This folder contains all the hardware-related files for the **Fishing Prediction System**. The files include PCB layouts, electrical schematics, and 3D models for both the central and peripheral device enclosures.

## Contents

### 1. **PCB Layout**
- **`PCB_layout.pdf`**:  
  This file contains the PCB layout used to connect the electronic modules of the central device. It serves as the foundation for integrating all components within the system.

### 2. **Electrical Schematic**
- **`SCH_Schematic.pdf`**:  
  This file provides the complete electrical schematic for the system. It details all the connections between the components, ensuring accurate assembly of the electronic modules.

### 3. **3D Models**
The folder includes `.stl` files for the enclosures of the central and peripheral devices, as well as demo files representing fully assembled devices:

#### Central Device:
- **`centralA.stl`** and **`centralB.stl`**:  
  These are the 3D models for the **enclosure of the central device**.
- **`central_device_demo.stl`**:  
  This file represents the **fully assembled central device**, showcasing how the components fit together.

#### Peripheral Device:
- **`peripheralA.stl`** and **`peripheralB.stl`**:  
  These are the 3D models for the **enclosure of the peripheral device**.
- **`peripheral_demo.stl`**:  
  This file represents the **fully assembled peripheral device**, providing a complete view of the final design.

## Usage Instructions
1. **PCB Layout**:  
   Use `PCB_layout.pdf` as a reference for creating the circuit board to connect the central device's electronic modules.
2. **Electrical Schematic**:  
   Refer to `SCH_Schematic.pdf` to ensure all components are correctly connected during assembly.
3. **3D Models**:  
   - Load the `.stl` files into a 3D modeling or printing tool to visualize or manufacture the enclosures.  
   - Use the `*_demo.stl` files to understand the final appearance of the fully assembled devices.

## Notes
- The `PCB_layout.pdf` and `SCH_Schematic.pdf` files are crucial for ensuring proper hardware functionality.  
- The `.stl` files allow you to fabricate the physical enclosures for the devices and understand the assembly process.
